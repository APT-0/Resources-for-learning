# Learning resources & frequent tools for programming, security and general IT

Hi this is just a simple set of learning paths and tricks I found to help me, this is a quick list and is broken out into some sub paths. If you have suggestions feel free to comment or create an issue or pull request. This can be openly shared and modified.

## Programming

  ### Python
  #### Websites
  - [Offical python site for getting started and tutorials](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) <-- This is a great place to get started, goes over different text editors, has a link to python libraries, tutorials etc.
  #### Books
  - [(Free)(General python - Great for beginning through some experienced) "Automate the boring stuff"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) <-- Great for some practical challenges and beginning to write some code
  #### Cheat sheets
  - [Python cheat sheet](https://github.com/APT-0/python-cheatsheet)

  ### C++
  (To be added)
  
  ### Javascript
  -[Hacking javascript - "untrusted"](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/)
  
  ### Other
  - [Regular Expressions - testing: regex101](https://regex101.com/)
  - [Decode / Encode: Cyberchef.io](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) 
  - [Development enviroment - IDE/Text editor (VScode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <-- Theres other text editors and IDEs like Atom, sublime, eclipse. VScode is my favorite as extensions make adding new programming languages easy and add on almost anything else you can imagine to help from running a live server, debugging, dev containers, live share "peer" program, docker to build and ship your apps.

## Red Team / Pen Test
### Websites
- [Hands on learning game style - Tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com/) <-- This is personally one of my favorite websites there are complete virtual machines on here that can get you started with learning basic linux commands, python, hacking, networking, and some blue team functions.

## Learning Tips 
These are just a few cool things that helped me learn, and search for answers quickly.
1. Start a library of all your code or projects, Github is the easiest way to share all your cool projects once you have a few.
2. Get google drive and store PDFs from sites like humble bundle, every 3ish weeks they will come out with a new bundle of about 12ish books on topics from Python, to web application hacking or focused on linux only for $5-$15, just pick the ones you want to learn now or a later date. You can search the contents of all your books for keywords to quickly search hundreds of books in google drive at only $2 a month for 100GB.
3. Make a plan of what your goal is and layout what you want to learn, in small blocks of time each day maybe an hour or two focus on a book, website or another source to learn. Personally I think its difficult to learn if you arent doing what you want to learn hands on.
4. Join peer groups for your learning interest, I really like the app Discord and will have tons of people willing to mentor you. Just search for a group and join.
