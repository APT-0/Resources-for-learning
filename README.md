# Learning resources for programming, security and general IT

Hi this is just a simple set of paths I was interested in at some point and wanted to just compile a list of good resources and break out some learning paths. If you have suggestions feel free to comment or create an issue or pull request. This can be openly shared and modified.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/APT-0/Resources-for-learning/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/APT-0/Resources-for-learning/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
