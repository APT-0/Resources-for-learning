# Learning resources for programming, security and general IT

Hi this is just a simple set of learning paths and tricks I found, this is a quick list and is broken out into some sub paths. If you have suggestions feel free to comment or create an issue or pull request. This can be openly shared and modified.

## Programming

### Python

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/APT-0/Resources-for-learning/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
